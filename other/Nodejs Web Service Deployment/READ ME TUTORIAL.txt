1: Open the 'config.js' file in an editor and change the following:
	- name : '(web service title)',
	- description : '(web service description)',
	- script : '(web service app.js script location)',

	For Example:
    - name: 'Service Name',
    - description: 'Service Description',
    - script: 'here/there/everywhere/app.js'

2: Double click the 'install webservice.bat' file OR 'uninstall webservice.bat'

3: Say 'Yes' for everything and it should install / uninstall your Web Service automatically.
   It will pause the cmd for you in case an error was found, otherwise you can just close it.
