Create SSH Key

1. In powershell: ssh-keygen, press enter on everything
2. Open the file that got created (id_rsa.pud) and copy the key
3. Go to GitLab, SSH keys, and paste key you copied
4. ssh git@gitlab.com

make sure you configure your 'user.name' and 'user.email' in git

git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME" (like "Francois Kruger")
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

---------------------------------

VSCODE CAN'T SEE GIT REPO
If you run "git status" in the same folder, and you see an error like:
fatal: unsafe repository ('/media/data1/project1/si/project' is owned by someone else.

Then you can try and run:
git config --global --add safe.directory *

If you get the error: wrong number of arguments, should be 2
git config --global --add safe.directory "*"

To fix it

---------------------------------

- 1: Open GitLab website and go to "Access Tokens" https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
- 2: Create a new Access Token, check all the permissions you need
- 3: After creating one, copy the token created at the top of the page

- 4: In SourceTree, go to Options/Authentication/add
- 5: Change the host to Gitlab
- 6: Hit the "Refresh Personal Access Token" button
- 7: This should popup a new window where you enter your
	- username (Gitlab username, NOT EMAIL, like "@Francois_Kruger_Triggerfish"
	- password (the token you copied at step 3)

- ? If the popup doesn't open on step 7, try logging in first by going to the "earth globe" ("Remote") on the
    sourcetree UI and logging in like that.

-----------

If you get any "host" issues, try this:
ssh git@gitlab.com

Try just recloning/re-copy-pasting the repo if you have issues pushing and pulling
