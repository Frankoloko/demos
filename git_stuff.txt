- 1: Open GitLab website and go to "Access Tokens" https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
- 2: Create a new Access Token, check all the permissions you need
- 3: After creating one, copy the token created at the top of the page

- 4: In SourceTree, go to Options/Authentication/add
- 5: Change the host to Gitlab
- 6: Hit the "Refresh Personal Access Token" button
- 7: This should popup a new window where you enter your
	- username (Gitlab username, NOT EMAIL, like "@Francois_Kruger_Triggerfish"
	- password (the token you copied at step 3)

- ? If the popup doesn't open on step 7, try logging in first by going to the "earth globe" ("Remote") on the
    sourcetree UI and logging in like that.
