They both have upsides and downsides. Neither is better. Pick whatever you want. Personally, I have only rarely painted from life in my life. Like maybe 1% of all my painting ever have been done from life.

Benefits from Pictures:
- You can capture a moment. In painting from life it is literally impossible to capture the frozen image of a chameleon's tunge extended out to catch a fly or a spots playing frozen in a perfect action. It is also hard to capure the mood of light and so on since it can change so fast in real life.
- It is more comformtable. Obviously. You can sit conformtably in your preparend environment. You don't have wind or light or rain problems.
- You can revise work later on. You can come to the same painting, with the same variables, and compare and find problems. In real life you can practically never return to the same momemt of variables to compare your result in.

Benefits from Life:
- You see much greater colours, detail and value. Pictures and digital screens, as amazing as they are, are still nothing compared to the human eye. I don't understand this, but it is true. If your goal use UTTER PERFECT REALISM, then you have no choice but to work from life. I've seen painting done from life that literally look more real than real life. You need to see this to understand it. Because as the point explains, I cannot show you this through a digital screen. I urge you to see out the greatest art studios in your area or the X mentioned website and see if you can find a realism painting like this to view in real life. It is truly marvelous.

Personally, I just prefer the comfort of painting, pausing for a long time, coming back to continue. Reviewing etc. I get overwhelmed when painting from life and then I tend to overthink stupid problems like getting things perfect before starting and so on.
