This is another one of those ideas I really don't understand. But for some reason, in watercolour specifically, the more layers you add, the worse the painting becomes. FOR MY STYLE/PREFERECE OF WATERCOLOR.

I can't tell you why. I would honestly love if someone could help me understand why. But what I can tell you is to try it yourself. I only realized this when I did value studies of my Minx painting.

Personally, I aim for around 3 layers at most for 90% of the painting. Smaller details like the face will then get a bit more work.
