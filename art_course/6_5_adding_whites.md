There are a few tricks arists use to add white to a painting. I prefer to use none of them and these are the reasons why:
- Masking fluid. I don't like this for 2 reasons. One, unless the masking fluid is white, it makes it really hard to judge how your painting is looking while you are painting. And two, I dislike the "perfect shapes" that it creates when you remove it. All in all, I really just don't think my final painting looks better when using it. So therefore I don't use it.
- Adding guache or acrilic whites. I am by no means a purist. Please use this if you like. But personally I just think there is something "uncanny valley" about a white paint from another medium. Something in my brain just tells me "that's not real". Also, it rarely even makes the painting better. Often these abrupt white spots actually ruin a painting more than they help with the painting.
- Scratching the paper. I honestly have never tried this. But I would imagin that damaging the paper can surely not make the painting look better. But I still need to give this a shot.
- I think that not relying on making it white later on, will make you plan your painting more precisely. And I think better planning will lead to a better final painting.
