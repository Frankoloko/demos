* Honestly, I find little to no difference between expensive and cheap paper. I really don't. I completely disagrew with other painters who often say that paper is the most important purchase you should make. I feel exactly the opposite. Paint is the most important, brushes second, and paper last.

* What paper do I buy. Honestly, literally any paper I find that is decently affordable.
