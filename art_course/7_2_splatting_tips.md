* I used to splat the colours all over the painting. Don't do that. Only splat them near the colour you are using.
* Be careful of splatting the wrong colour on the wrong place. A single dark spot on a face can completely ruin it and make it look like someone has a black eye.
* Be mindful of where you splat. I used to splat all over my table, pc screens and other paintings. I now have a basic card board wall I put up. I would them place the painting down on the floor, do the splats, then pick it back up and continue painting.
* Don't feel like you have to fill all the spaces with splats. You need to be selective. Beginners often want to "fill in" areas with splats. That mindset is wrong. You should only have a few, well placed splats.
