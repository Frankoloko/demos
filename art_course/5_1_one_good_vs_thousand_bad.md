If you take only 1 point way from this course. Take this away. Seriously, this is by far the idea that the most people get wrong. And it is also the idea that served me the greatest in my career.

Don't paint a thousand good paintings if you want to improve. Paint one painting a thousand times.

The reason for this is simple. I believe that you learn 10% in the first 90% of your painting. And you learn 90% in the last 10% of your painting. You only start learning things when the painting becomes really hard. When you look at it and you know it is bad but you don't know what to improve. When you think "I'm done" but the next day you look at it and see something is wrong.

I also believe this idea translates to everything else in life. If you want to get good at something, don't repeat the actions a 1000 times and expect to get better, try to redo the same action 1000 times until it is perfect.
