* Do you have to? Yes. Otherwise the paper gets wraped and your paint flows in weird ways. It can become impossible to get the top of a bubbled paper to be the darkest spot. Because the water will always run down the bubble.

* I dislike staples because they create these stretched marks that are borderline imposssible to get rid of. Taping does not create the same problem. The entire page might warp with tape, but you can flatted it out afterwards.

* I dislike a staple gun. Firstly because I don't like the texture of a wooden board. There is probably nothing wrong with it, I haven't tried it. But I also dislike the noise in my small apartment. And I also dislike the way you need to pull the nails out. It's really hard and they often break. Leaving you with a board with many metal pins.

* Gum tape is my current favourite method. One extremely important point that I got wrong at the start, is to overwet the tape. This will cause it to tear when drying.
