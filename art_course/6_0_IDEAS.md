In art, I truly believe it is important to value your final painting over everything else.
- If your final painting turns out better if you jog in the morning, then you jog in the morning.
- If your final painting turns out better after you've eaten 4 and a half eggs, then you eat 4 and a half eggs.
- If your final painting turns out better when you use the cheaper paint, then you use the cheaper paint.
Should I keep going or do you get my point?

Now, the reason I trace is for a few reasons:
1. My final painting is better. No matter how long I try to draw by eye, it is never as accurate as just copying the reference directly. Therefore, tracing improves my final painting.
2. By complete accident, I realized once that charcoal tracing paper adds a type of oil barrier to my canvas. It creates these interesting textures that I like. They improve my final painting in my opinion, therefore I want to keep them.
3. I hate drawing. To my brain, the act of drawing is a technicaly skill. It is a problem that you can solve with a ruler. If you can solve it with a ruler, then you might as well solve it with a trace. Why use the less useful tool if you could use a more useful tool? Because of this mindset, my mind utterly hates battling with drawings. Because I immiately want to pick up a ruler or just trace it to get it done. So personally, I hate the drawing phase and I would prefer to just not do it.
4. Tracing saves time. It is by far the fastest method to getting a drawing done. If you save time, you can spend it better elsewhere. Whether that is to pump out more drawings to make more money, spend more time on leasure, or spend more time learning other things. Whatever you prefer.
5. Erasing ruins the paper. Any type of erasing, is literally microscopic damage on the paper. It is best to never bring an eraser anywhere near your final painting. To make this point more clear, over-erase your paper and then paint over it. You need to do that yourself once to understand this point. Please go and do it yourself.

All in all, I want to end in saying this is completely a personal preferece. I have no problem at all with people who prefer to draw. If anything, I envy their dedication.

THAT SAID. Don't let me ever find you with bad drawings in your final painting. What is a bad drawing? Is it a skew line? No. A deliberate skew line is still art. A bad drawing is a non deliberate skew line. And I can point out many of my personal great influences who skipped having a good drawing and they are making massive mistakes in my opinion.

So, by all means draw, I think someone who draws will technically outskill a tracer. But don't let me ever fucking find you painting a final masterpiece where your drawings are off. Because in the order of what makes a painting bad you'll find:
1. Drawing does the most damage
2. Values do the second most damage
3. Colour thereafter
4. Composition last. It is clear that composition is last because if you perfectly copy a picture, then you did no composition. And the painting will still be amazing.
