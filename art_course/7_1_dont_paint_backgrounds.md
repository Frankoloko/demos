* I can't yet understand this point. But painting the backgrounds just don't turn out well for the style I enjoy. I realized this when I painted a picture of my friends cat. When I painted a picture of my own cat, I never added the folds because I was too scared to get them wrong. But with my friend's cat, when I added the background, it immediately sucked the magic out of my painting. I did another painting after that that proved my idea. I don't know why, but don't paint backgrounds.
