Why buy this course
* I share information here that I do not ever share elsewhere. I deliberately try to not share course information and ideas elsewhere. Whether that is on YouTube, Patreon, interviews or blogs. I hold high the agreement between you and I that you pay a lot of money for exclusive information.
* I am honest. I will share what I know and make clear what I don't know. I will update the course when I have changed my mind about a concept or realize that I was wrong. Whatever is in the course, represents actively the way I paint and think.
* I constantly update the course. Whenever I lear something new, change my mind on a topic, or realise that I forgot to share something, I will update the course. You are buying a forever growing living course.
* Because I constantly update the course with more information, I also increase its price. Once bought, you will forever receive the updates. So buying the course early, is a growing investment for yourself.
* This course is long and in depth. A problem I personally have with other course like Masterclass, Udemy and Domestica. Their content is often extremely short. I dislike that when I want to learn something of value.
* This course, is my highest priority. Higher than my art or skill. I give you my promise that you are buying my utmost premium product.
* You will meet me. Another problem I have with Masterclass, Udemy & Domestic is that you never meet the course creator. Sure those courses are cheaper so that's a fair agreement. But here you pay more and you will receive more. I personally meet (digitally) every single person that buys my course. I am only a human and unfortunately my time is not infinite. But I will make and find time to meet you.
* It is expensive because it is my greatest product. I make my living from the course and from art. I share all my secrets here. If there is any "secret" you want to know, I'll update the course to share it. You wouldn't expect McDonalds to share their secret recipe for very cheaply. For that same reason I can't give away my life's learnings for cheaply. Doing so would not be fair to me.

Who should buy this course
* If you like my art style and would like to paint like me
* If you are a beginner. I share a lot of wisdom in terms of my artistic growth. These ideas and values will serve you greatly to keep you on a good path when training yourself in art.
* If you would like to understand how I think. I share more than technical tricks here. I share the backgrounds and "why's" behind my decisions. I go through historic changes I've made. I share how I think, not only what I do.
* Someone who prefers longer style course formats.

Who should not buy this course
* Concept artists or designers. I don't teach anything related to imaginative art. Most of the time we will be copying a reference image.
* A proffesional. I share a lot of information that would benefit most beginners. Let's be honest, if you are a professional in art, you would only appreciate about 30% of my course. If that is you, I aprpeciate your support I'd love to share what I know. But do know that a lot many chapters will not be geared towards you.
* People who prefer short and fast styles of courses. My videos are long, the journey is long.
