So, technically I'm just repeating what I said in the previous point. But, that said, I think there is value in just thinking vaguely of the idea of "put more detail in my focal point"

Richard Schmid does this really well. Study a lot of his painting to understand my point.

If you enjoy my loose style of art, then this is probably one of the biggest skills you need to learn. Because it is vital to the success of my style of art.
