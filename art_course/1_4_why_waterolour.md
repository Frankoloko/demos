I think it is important to know why you pick a medium. Because it's good to not constantly look at other mediums and envy their benefits. All mediums have benefits and negatives.

Why do I, personally, prefer watercolour?
- I enjoy the challenge of the water. There is something fun about needing to battle this uncontrollable substance.
- I enjoy more loose looking art. Watercolour is great for this style because the medium naturally tends towards this direction.
- I enjoy the ease of use. You can literally just pick up a glass of water and start painting by wetting your dry paint. The cleanup process is also really simple. In most other mediums you have to go through quite a tedious starting and stopping process. Like in oil you have to wash your brushes after painting otherwise you lose them forever.
- The medium forces you to think about light vs dark. Because you cannot ever paint white. it is an important fundamental process to think about light vs dark instead of local colours and values. So having a medium that forces you to think that way is a useful learning tool.
- I have done other mediums, and it is just magically the one that stuck with me. Nothing more than that.
