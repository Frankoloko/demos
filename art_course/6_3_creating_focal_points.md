Focal points are all about contast.
1. Contrast in colour
2. Contrast in saturation
3. Contrast in values
4. Contrast in texture (all scratches in one direction vs a block of scratches in the other direction)
5. Contrast in sharpness (blurry vs detailed)
6. Object (human face pulls more attention than a cloth)
7. Story. If there is a mystery to uncover or a thread to follow, the eye and mind will follow it wherever the painting wants you to go.
