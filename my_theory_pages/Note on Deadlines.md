A deadline is only valid if the executor agreed to the deadline.

A deadline is not valid if the managing party just decided on a date themselves.

Generally, most things cannot have deadlines. Most projects that are hard do not have a predictable exact deadline date. It is just the nature of hard things. Rockets went over their deadlines, important movies and games went over their deadlines. Easy things like painting a wall, could have a deadline. A harder task like painting a city, is not exactly taking one wall's time and multiplying it.

The harder the task, the less predictable the deadline. Even the smartest group of humans with infinite money could not tell you when they would have a teleportation device working. But the speed of painting a wall could be predicted quite accurately without even being a painter.

Instead of an exact date, a range could be more realistic. And "more realistic" benefits both the executor and the payer.

Generally, deadlines should be longer than whatever you think. When asked for deadlines, humans tend to pick the minimum time spent. Generally that is wrong because it doesn't account for abnormalities, which are normal to come up.

It is important to think of deadlines more as percentages, not as actual dates. For example, if something should take 5 days, but took 6, that was a 20% increase in the resources spent. That's a big dead actually. If something had a deadline for 10 years, and took one day month longer to achieve. That's significantly less important than the one day difference of 5 vs 6 days.
