# Make it as small as possible

Make the parts as small as possible. Small parts are more easily tested and replaced by better parts in the future.

The same reason you don't build a car engine from one massive steel block. A core engineering principle is to make things small and easily testable.

# Understandability over performance

In Pipeline (specifically in Pipeline!) performance is not a very important factor. Therefore, weight the scale more towards making code understandable. Making code more understandable will make it easier for newcomers to learn and less likely to cause problems because of confusion.

# Comment well

It is important to note big blocks of logic with human words. Therefore making it easier and faster to understand. While also lowering the chance of confusion that could lead to problems.

Too much commenting is better than too little commenting.
