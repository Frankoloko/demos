# Ask questions and find answers

I used to call this point "Be Curious". But that's too vague. "Ask questions" is a more practical tip.

I truly believe that the smartest people in the world, ask questions often, about anything they don't understand.

Reading a book teaches you something, but not that much. But having a question, then finding a book that might answer that question, then reading that, will teach you a lot!

There is a lot of value in having the question ready by the time you approach the knowledge base. Just consuming the knowledge base without any questions is not as impactful (although of course still useful).

Personally, it's one of the important factors of being a living thing. Living things are curious, AI robots, no matter how smart, can never be curious. A cat is curious, if you hide your hand behind a blanket then it's eyes open up wide, wondering what the hand is doing or where it went. Curiosity is one of our greatest values.

Also, it's one thing to ask questions, but never act on answering them. Everyone is curious all the time. But only diligent people spend the time answering questions and learning.

To me, a practical way of doing this, is to keep a notepad on my phone where you write down any questions as they come up. Then one day when you have time you can go through the list and ticket the items off.

Be curious.

Curiosity killed the kat, but it also helped the cat develop to one of the most intelligent and successful species on earth. Non-curiosity (like a cow just grazing all day) leave you vulnerable to more intelligent creatures.

That said, be careful of not learning so much that you become an intelligence snob. People don't want to know everything and hear every fancy word you can say. Many times people just want to laugh and have human interactions.

* Write down questions that pop up, and answer them later when you have time
* Don't become an intelligence snob

# Dream big

Another important skill that robots will never replace, is the ability to have a dream an execute it. To have a vision and work towards it.

Think of it as being a film director. James Cameron had this vision of blue people on another planet. The vision took thousands of people and thousands of hours to make a reality. Elon Musk has this vision of reusing space rockets. A robot can have all the skill in the world, but will always lack vision.

Get good at dreaming and having visions. It is a skill that no machine will ever replace.

# Strive to be a nice person

Really work hard to be nice. Work hard to care about others. Work hard to be a good parent, child, friend. Give gifts. Smile often. Make jokes. Do effort. Say hi to your neighbors.

In modern society, people undervalue being nice to others. It used to be of great value in smaller communities, but loses it's value greatly in larger cities.

This assumes the opposite, not being a bad person. Not lying. Not stealing. Not murdering. Not littering. Not bullying. And any other harmful act.

# Manage your finances

Finances are really your accumulated value as a person. As a person you have done deeds for others, which in turn has given you value-coins to spend. Don't waste your value. Manage your value-coins.

Don't lend money. Don't waste your money on stupid things. Count your money. Know where your money goes. Care about your income and increasing it. Care about your expenses and decreasing it. Save money for the future.

A person who doesn't manage their money, can live a life that is truly dark and horrible. Waking up one day realizing you are in unimaginable debt, is a seriously suicidal thought and not an easy problem to solve. Don't get there in the first place.

# Don't waste time

You know what wasting time is. Nothing needs to teach it to you. You know in your soul when the action you are doing is a waste of time. Whether that is scrolling on your phone for hours. Watching TV all day every day. Playing games all the time. Whatever your concept of wasting time is. Stop wasting time.

Note here, that I'm not saying, for example, playing games is a waste of time. To some, like professional gamers, it is a very valuable thing. But to me personally, I don't plan on becoming a professional gamer. To me some explorative games are are good because I learn and think about new things. But to me, playing the same shooter game over and over, is a waste of time. Point is, the concept of wasting time is up to the person them self.

Personally I feel this is probably the greatest point that made me skyrocket above my peers in life. I have an unhealthy hate of wasting time. To me every second should be spent on improving at something. I don't think you should live life like that, it's unhealthy, but that's the mindset I am referring to when I say don't waste time.

Keep in mind, smaller actions are still a good way to spend time. Spending time with your wife or children, is still a valuable way to spend time.

Stephen Hawing is a great person to read about if you care about this topic. From his twenties doctors told him you have one year to live. He lived to 76 while doctors kept telling him this every year. So he was an expert at how to not waste your time.

This is also a great point for your job one day. Just being an employee that doesn't waste time. Who spends their 8 hours doing actual work. Is already the top % of valuable employees at any company.

# Stay healthy

The body is a machine. A machine needs to be taken care of otherwise it will break or not perform well. As simple as that.

* Eat well: Someone has a good quote for this. Eat real food (so not processed foods), not too much, mostly greens (meat should be included, but majority greens is better).
* Workout: Up to you to decide how much and if your lifestyle requires it. I work at a computer all day. I need to work out often. A builder might not. So you decide.
* Don't get fat: Honestly, being fat is just an easy indicator that you aren't healthy. So fix it.
* Don't smoke
* Don't do too much soft drugs (alcohol/weed) and never touch hard drugs (meth etc). In general, doing no drugs at all seem to be a better bet than doing any drugs at all. Many great people in life don't consume much drugs, and only a rare few ever succeed consuming drugs.
