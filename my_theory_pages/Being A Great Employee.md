# Never Speak Bad Of Someone

Speaking bad of someone will create enemies of them when they hear that, diminishing your pool of helpful friends/knowledge.

Being negative is honestly just not fun to be around.

Being negative as a leader, and playing the blame game, will lead to your followers doing the same. Breeding a horrible environment.

My only moral dilemma here is that, when someone is truly a problem. Then it needs to get raised. How does one do that without speaking bad of someone?

# Report Well

A good employee doesn't just do the work, but has a good skill in reporting progress.

Whether that is a junior reporting to a senior, or a CEO reporting to investors. Everyone needs to be good at reporting progress.

# Do An Honest Day's Work

You are supposed to do 8 hours of work. Do that.

Sure time off here and there is a human thing, we are not robots, but it should not become the norm.
