# Never speak bad of someone

Speaking bad of someone will create enemies of them when they hear that, diminishing your pool of helpful friends/knowledge.

Being negative is honestly just not fun to be around.

Being negative as a leader, and playing the blame game, will lead to your followers doing the same. Breeding a horrible environment.

My only moral dilemma here is that, when someone is truly a problem. Then it needs to get raised. How does one do that without speaking bad of someone?

# Report well

A good employee doesn't just do the work, but has a good skill in reporting progress.

Whether that is a junior reporting to a senior, or a CEO reporting to investors. Everyone needs to be good at reporting progress.

You cannot do, even amazing work, in pure isolation. Reporting means you care about others around you.

# Do an honest day's work

You are supposed to do 8 hours of work. Do that.

Sure time off here and there is a human thing, we are not robots, but it should not become the norm.

# Be nice

I find it alarming how little people care about human relationships in today's workplaces. People care only about work, and very little about our relationships with one another.

Ask what people did on the weekend, say hi, say bye, ask how are they doing. Of course you don't need to be asking this every freaking day, but in general, care about people's lives!

# Being a professional

Writing neat emails. Not getting emotional in meetings. Not shitting on a teammate in public. Being on time. Replying when you need to.

Being good at this is not a debate or a reward. It should be the ground level of expectation.
