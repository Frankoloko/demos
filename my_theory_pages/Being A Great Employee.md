# Never speak bad of someone

Speaking bad of someone will create enemies of them when they hear that, diminishing your pool of helpful friends/knowledge.

Being negative is honestly just not fun to be around.

Being negative as a leader, and playing the blame game, will lead to your followers doing the same. Breeding a horrible environment.

My only moral dilemma here is that, when someone is truly a problem. Then it needs to get raised. How does one do that without speaking bad of someone?

# Report well

A good employee doesn't just do the work, but has a good skill in reporting progress.

Whether that is a junior reporting to a senior, or a CEO reporting to investors. Everyone needs to be good at reporting progress.

You cannot do, even amazing work, in pure isolation. Reporting means you care about others around you.

# Do an honest day's work

You are supposed to do 8 hours of work. Do that.

Sure time off here and there is a human thing, we are not robots, but it should not become the norm.

# Be nice

I find it alarming how little people care about human relationships in today's workplaces. People care only about work, and very little about our relationships with one another.

Ask what people did on the weekend, say hi, say bye, ask how are they doing. Of course you don't need to be asking this every freaking day, but in general, care about people's lives!

# Being a professional

Writing neat emails. Not getting emotional in meetings. Not shitting on a teammate in public. Being on time. Replying when you need to.

Being good at this is not a debate or a reward. It should be the ground level of expectation.

# Be calm

A good leader is ALWAYS calm. I don't think showing positive excitement is bad. But showing high energy anger or displeasure is always bad. A leader should be able to calmly disagree. Reason being, a leader's opinion is extremely strong. Imagine if superman had a temper, what a problem that would be.

A powerful leader can also calmly disagree against force with great power. Imagine someone talking shit to superman and he just says "All good". You'd crap your pants. Like you parent telling you "Fine, do it then". Point is, even faced with great anger, a great leader and debater can calmy disagree, with power.

When angered, GREATLY judge your own words before speaking/typing.

A great leader, should only show negative emotion when the problem repeats it self. You should never show negative emotion on the first or even second/third instances. Because, on the first instance the person might not have know, so showing negative action would just damage your relationship, since the negative action was not valid. Second/Third you should still be calm because people still need to learn a habit, even once they know it. But thereafter, you are welcome to start voicing your opinion powerfully because then it might be a problem you have to address.

Leaders naurally cause a mute effect. Jeff Bezos mentioned this once. That he learnt that if he speaks first, then no one with oposing ideas will raise then ideas. So he mentioned that you should have the most junior people speak first and move towards the most senior people. This way you get the most opinions out of a topic. The junior might feel bad for being wrong, but they shouldn't be judged by a senior since the senior is aware they are still learning. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sjkTBUQgeH0
A negative leader causes a Mute effect. If they always disagree with great emotion, it is not a state you as employee enjoys. Therefore, even if the leader is wrong, you prefer to just shut up than to debate the topic. If the leader was more calm, a debate might occur and the best answer might be found.

# Improve how someone does something, don't improve the task

If you improve the task, then you only improve the outtcome of this one task and margnially improve the person (if they realize their mistake and know how to improve it)
If you improve the person, you grow the person and you automatically improve the task and future tasks.

# Delegating Work: Understand the difference between a Goal and a Problem

I think managers often get stuck writing out the Goal in 100 different ways and not supplying enough Problems for people to solve.

A good example is: Our goal with this epic is to ship this car from USA to China. You can write out a 100 points about that goal:
- This needs to be done in 2 weeks
- The budget must not exceed X
- The car must not get damaged

This is all valuable informations. But there is no task to action on these words. Instead, managers should often focus less on writing out Goals and more on identifying Problems. Because Problems are generally good tasks:
- Find out what shipping costs from USA to China
- Find out what passports we need
- Find out what import/export taxes will hit us

Those are mostly research problems. Now think of the Execusion Problems.
- Get the car from the building to the USA docks
- Ship the car
- Get the car from the China docks to the warehouse

These 3 obviously raise many new questions as well:
- Where is the USA warehouse
- How much fuel do we need to get to the docs
- How long does the sea travel take
- Does an employee need to be on the boat with the sea travel
- Where is the China warehouse
- Where do we get fuel in China

From the simple goal, we have already created many tasks and we can continue doing so quite easily. And no, a good leader doesn't have to know all these things. A good leader knows how to use his team to help him get all these answers instead of doing everything himself.

# Being a good leader: Write down questions

Whenever someone asks you something you don't know. If it is a valueable thing to learn more about, then write it down and go learn about it later on.

A great leader has answers to many questions.
