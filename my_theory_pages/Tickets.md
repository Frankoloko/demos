# Bug

## Recreate

How can you consistently recreate the problem. Not finding this out early could cause you waste time testing unrelated components or be confused about the actual end goal.

Knowing how to recreate the problem, also gives you the test to check if your solution worked.

## Why

Knowing the final why is important for creativity.

If you give someone a task, their only solution is to complete the task. If you give someone a why, then they can use whatever task they want to achieve the why. This leads to better and more creative solutions, better engagement, greater ownership and a better final product.

## Final Checklist

An exact outline of the final results you are trying to get to.

### Parties Involved Being On The Same Page

Not having this, is an indicator parties involved aren't clear about the end goal.

### Expectations, Deadlines, Goal-posts

Not having this will cause many future problems regarding expectations, deadlines, goal-post shifting etc.

### When Is Done

You require the checklist to know when you are done. If I tell you to plant grass to saved the planet. You can never actually complete that task? When is enough grass enough? But if I tell you once you planted 500 patches of grass, you are done. Now there is an end goal to check off.

### Be Clear

Be sure you are as clear as possible about this. Just saying "I want the pipeline to work with asset variants" is not enough. You need to be clear with a checklist that says importing an asset should work, exporting an asset  should work, updating an asset should work.

## Raise Questions

Ask as many questions as you can. Not all questions need to be answered right away. But solving as many of them before starting the task, will help a lot in stopping road blocks before you get to them, getting expectations in line, questioning designs before wasting time going in the wrong direction and speeding up the task once it is started.

What will the UI look like, can we draw this out on paper? What colour should the top menu be? In what repo should the code go? In what application will the code run?

Often, if you spend a lot of time asking enough questions, the change can take extremely fast to execute since you know exactly what to do.
