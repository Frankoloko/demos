# General Theory

## Tracing vs Drawing

This is a personal question, so mainly do whatever you prefer.

Personally, I have a few reasons for preferring tracing:
1. It is faster. For comission work, time is money.
2. Very little "personal touch" is ever added in the drawing phase, if any at all honestly.
3. Paintings with incorrect drawings are bad, with no exceptions. The only good-incorrect drawings are deliberate style choices like caricatures
4. For comission work, especially a face of someone, having a correct drawing and giving the client a perfect painting is more important than your pride.
5. It makes the final product better. I don't think there are any paintings where a non-drawing would be better than a drawing.
6. You should draw to practice getting better and trace to paint something you know will be hanged on a wall or sold to a client.
7. You ruin the paper because you have to, even just a little, erase and redraw lines. Another reason why the final product will be less good.

Personally, drawing for the sake of placing elements to paint, is a purely technicaly problem that you can solve with a ruler. And if I can solve it with a ruler, then I might as well solve it with a projector or any other tracing method. Not wanting to use any tools, would be like saying "draw me a line exactly 26.32cm long" and then you decide you are a purist that doesn't want to use a ruler.

## Watercolor Cubes vs Tubes

I prefer Cubes for a few reasons:
- I always have all my colours for every painting
- I don't need to solve the problem of "how much of this colour do I need to squeeze out for this painting"
- I love the idea that my colours just dry after using it, and they are ready right away when I need them again

Update: I think letting a tube dry in a pan is exactly the same thing, so I guess it doesn't matter.

## Start at the focal point

I often used to start by doing the background and/or big colours. I think this is wrong. I think you need to start at the focal point, perfect it, and move on from there.

- If you follow this approach, the painting can be "done" at almost any point after the focal point is completed.
- I think this is how you truly achieve that "loose" look. You don't achieve that loose look by starting with loose strokes. You achieve it by completing the focal point, because then after that any strokes can be messy or unfinished.
- If you mess up the focal point, you can restart early. Instead of finishing 90% of the painting, then doing the focal point, then messing up, and then restarting 95% of your work again.

## Why watercolor vs other mediums

- It's setup is easy. You just wet your previously used paints and work.
- Easy cleanup. You just leave your pallete to dry. You just was brushes in water.
- It forces you to think about color vs light because of it's useless white paint.
